# BibeExcBot

BibeExcBot is a tool designed to help players avoid being detected as AFK, while providing AI-driven responses (GPT-4-turbo) to other characters interacting with yours. The bot ensures smooth roleplaying continuity by utilizing AI features and Discord integration for remote control of the application.
